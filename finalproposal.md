# FINAL PROPOSAL

## Topic : 
Understanding the contributing factor for vehicle crashes dataset of New York city

## Problem Statement : 
Understanding the vehicle crashes dataset of New York and develop a multiclass classifier to classify the contributing factor for those crashes

## About the data :
The Motor Vehicle Collisions vehicle table contains details on each vehicle involved in the crash.** Each row represents a motor vehicle involved in a crash**. The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system.

The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage.

## Data Source :

## What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?
Understanding the New York automobile collision dataset and developing a multiclass classifier to categorize the main factors for those collisions.
## Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?
## What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
## Where do you get the data to analyze and help answer your questions (creditability of source, quality of data, size of data, attributes of data. etc.)?
## What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units (observations) do you expect to analyze?
## What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis (variables should be tied to the questions in #3)?
## What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use (for example, clustering, NLP, ARIMA, etc.)?
## How do you plan to develop/apply ML and how you evaluate/compare the performance of the models?
## What outcomes do you intend to achieve (better understanding of problems, tools to help solve problems, predictive analytics with practicle applications, etc)?
